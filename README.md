## Installation

### Vue.js Frontend:
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imprvhub/cinemathe.git
```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```
3. Before running the project, you need to set up your environment variables in a .env file. Here's how:
```bash
FRONTEND_URL=<Specify the URL where your frontend will be hosted, e.g., 'https://localhost:3000' or your custom domain.>
API_KEY=<Provide your TMDB API key here>
SUPABASE_URL=<Enter the URL for your database, e.g., your Supabase database URL>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<Enter the anonymous key for your database, e.g., your Supabase anonymous key>    
```
  By default, Cinemathe is configured to work with Supabase as the backend DRF database. However, you can use another database if needed. Simply replace DATABASE_URL and DATABASE_ANON_KEY with the appropriate values based on your database configuration.

4. Run the project:
  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```
  The project should be accesible at, e.g., 'http://localhost:3000'

### Conclusion:

#### Achievements:
- **Synergistic Integration:** Successfully integrated Vue.js and Django Rest Framework, two less commonly paired technologies, this presented me with an intriguing challenge. Despite my prior experience with Django, blending it with Vue.js required careful problem-solving and adaptability. I successfully tackled hurdles encountered while implementing Django user authentication.

- **Streamlined UX/UI Integration and Data Management:**  Successfully tackled the complexities of UX/UI design, encompassing the management of diverse global and dynamic components, API integration, seamless data transmission between frameworks, and robust user experience and authentication. Despite initial complexities, diligent effort and incremental improvements paved the way for adept navigation through these challenges.

##### Learnings:
- **Improvements Through Perseverance:** This project allowed me to delve even deeper into the world of Vue.js. Just three months ago, facing the implementation of Vue.js seemed daunting due to its complexity. However, thanks to daily and constant effort, as well as my perseverance, I not only managed to understand the underlying logic required, but I also exceeded my initial expectations. This experience not only motivated me to explore new possibilities but also pushed me to implement features that I previously considered beyond my reach, especially in the frontend realm.
This project consolidated my perseverance and commitment to continuous learning. The consistent dedication to this project not only strengthened my confidence but also significantly expanded my skill set. From the start of the planning process to the successful conclusion of the project, this journey highlights how perseverance and dedicated effort can transform both personal and professional growth.
